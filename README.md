# Exploration-and-Predictive-Analysis-of-Cryptocurrency-Trading-with-Binance-History-Data
In this project, we have studied on the Binance full history data from Kaggle. This is typical time-series-based big data on which there are very few previous researches. 

We try to predict and classify future volatilties by applying machine learning models to the data with the help of **Amazon EMR Cluster** and **Apache Spark**. 

Hopefully, our research can shed some light on how to predict the volatilities of financial time series in the future.
